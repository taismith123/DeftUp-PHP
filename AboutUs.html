  <h2> The goal of DeftUP is to provide people with assistance in
    certain jobs/tasks that they canâ€™t get to or do not know how to accomplish.
    This includes tasks such as around-the-house yard work, mounting, furniture moving and assembly and so much more.
    DeftUP strives to create more jobs for 1-person businesses and provide the consumers
    that are hiring to get tasks done with more freedom to take care of other jobs/tasks that they have.
